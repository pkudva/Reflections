Shadows and Reflections
The project is the accumulation of rendering 3D objects onto a plane with textures, shadows, and reflections. 
It renders multiple objects with different textures to emphasize the need to reinitialize uniform variables.

To run this program, double click the table.html file with all the other files in the same directory.
